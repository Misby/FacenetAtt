## Black-Box Adversarial Attack on Public Face Recognition Systems

[Geekpwn CAAD](https://en.caad.geekpwn.org/) (Competition on Adversarial Attacks and Defenses) 2018,
is a competition that inherits the format of NIPS CAAD 2017, plus some new challenges.
In October 2018, me and [Cihang Xie](https://cihangxie.github.io/) were invited
to Geekpwn CAAD [CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/), a live competition with different types of adversarial attacks and defenses.

This CAAD CTF features a new challenge that asks teams to attack an unknown
face recognition system.
During the 30 minutes phase 1 competition, we were given an image of the
competition moderator Chang-Jian Jiang.
We need to make small modifications to the image,
in order to __fool the face recognition system to recognize it as Arnold Schwarzenegger__.
After the competition, we learned that the system we attacked was
[AWS Celebrity Recognition API](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-rekognition-update-celebrity-recognition/).

This repo contains code and several results of such attacks.

## Some Results

During the competition, we successfully attacked AWS to recognize Chang-Jian
Jiang as Schwarzenegger:

![AWS-JCJ](demo/AWS-JCJ.jpg)

The following one is slightly harder (lower success rate with varying random seeds),
probably because: (1) both source and target are American celebrities. (2) different gender

![AWS-Trump](demo/AWS-Trump.jpg)

Apparently,
[Azure Vision API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/)
and
[Clarifai Celebrity
Recognition](https://clarifai.com/models/celebrity-image-recognition-model-e466caa0619f444ab97497640cefc4dc)
can be fooled as well:

Original and adversarial versions of the above images can be found at [images/](images).
You can download them and try on the public APIs.

## Preparation to Use the Code

1. Install 2 > TensorFlow â‰¥ 1.7, OpenCV, tqdm, scikit-learn

2. Follow steps 1-4 in [facenet wiki](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/wiki/Validate-on-LFW) to setup facenet

3. Clone this repo and uncompress the pre-trained model inside:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/Adversarial-Face-Attack
cd Adversarial-Face-Attack
wget https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/Adversarial-Face-Attack/releases/download/v0.1/model-20180402-114759.tar.bz2
tar xjvf model-20180402-114759.tar.bz2
```
You can also [download the model from facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet#pre-trained-models).

4. Validate the model and the dataset:
```
./face_attack.py --data /path/to/lfw_mtcnnpy_160 --validate-lfw
# /path/to/lfw_mtcnnpy_160 is obtained above in step #4 in facenet wiki.
```

It should print a high accuracy on LFW, like:
```
Accuracy: 0.99517+-0.00361
Validation rate: 0.97467+-0.01454 @ FAR=0.00067
```

## Run attack

```bash
./face_attack.py --data /path/to/lfw_mtcnnpy_160 \
	--attack images/clean-JCJ.png \
	--target Arnold_Schwarzenegger \
	--output JCJ-to-Schwarzenegger.png
```

`--target` has to be a person which has many images (the more the better)
in the LFW dataset. Such person can be found by:

```bash
find /path/to/lfw_mtcnnpy_160/ -type f -printf "%h\0" | \
    xargs -0 -L1 basename | sort | uniq -c | sort -k1 -n
```

You can add new celebrities as victims in the LFW directory,
or add additional images for existing celebrities in LFW.
After adding new images, you'll need to repeat step 4 in facenet wiki,
to crop and align the images you add.

Note that the attack contains randomness: you'll not get the same output every time.
